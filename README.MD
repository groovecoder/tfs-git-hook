A simple git hook to allow a git commit message to update a TFS work item.

    Put #<WORK_ITEM_NUMBER> in your commit message and 'Fixed in revision <COMMIT_HASH>' will go into your item

    You can put multiple numbers as well i.e. #<WORK_ITEM_NUMBER>,<WORK_ITEM_NUMBER> or #<WORK_ITEM_NUMBER> blah blah blah ... #<WORK_ITEM_NUMBER>
